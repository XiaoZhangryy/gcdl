Description: Genes function in networks are typically correlated due to their functional connectivity. We construct confidence intervals and provide $p$-values for parameters of a high-dimensional linear model incorporating graphical structures where the number of variables $p$ diverges as the number of observations. For combining the graphical information, we propose a graph-constrained desparsified LASSO (GCDL) estimator, which reduces dramatically the influence of high correlation of predictors and enjoys the advantage of faster computation and higher accuracy compared with the desparsified LASSO.
